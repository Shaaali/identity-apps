# Users, Groups, and Roles

User management, in simple terms, is a process of efficiently managing users within a user store. User management is vital for any application since a user who is not authenticated and/or authorized properly will not be able to access the application and use it in a way that serves the user's requirements. On the other hand, users might be bombarded with unnecessary features of the application and information if the application cannot provide them with a filtered version as per their need. 

## What is a user?

A user is the digital representation of a physical user who interacts with applications. A user can be a digital identity of a human or a machine. A user can be recognized by a number of attributes. These are called **user attributes**. User attributes are data that defines the user, i.e., anything the user is, owned by, or associated with.

A unique **user account** is created for each user. Then they are assigned to roles or user groups that enable a certain set of permissions.
