# Onboard users

Adding new users to access your applications is called onboarding. There are different ways to onboard a user to Asgardeo. You can either send them an invitation to join or you can add them to the tenant yourself. 

- [Invite a user to set their own password](../tenant/invite-user-to-set-password.md)
- [Onboard a user with a temporary password](../tenant/onboard-user-with-password.md)
- [Invite a guest user](../tenant/invite-guest-user.md)

> For more information about the types of users you can onboard, see [types of users](../../concepts/user-mgt/user-types.md).
