# User Self-Service

An owner or a collaborator with administrative privileges can manage customer accounts. However, this is not always necessary since customers can easily manage their own Asgardeo accounts <a :href="$withBase('/guides/user-self-service/access-my-account/')">using the My Account portal</a>. This includes updating profile information, recovering passwords, managing consent and business applications they have access to, etc. They can also <a :href="$withBase('/guides/user-self-service/self-register')">self-register</a> to an organization. 

## Self-service capabilities for customers

Customers can easily access and self-manage their Asgardeo accounts from anywhere by using the [My Account portal](https://myaccount.asgardeo.io) for customers.

You can do the following on this portal:
- Update profile information
- Change password
- View and revoke consents given to applications
- View linked social accounts
- View and revoke active sessions
- Update the account recovery email
- Discover and maintain your applications
- Enroll TOTP
