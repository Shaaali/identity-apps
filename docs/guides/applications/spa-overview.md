# Single page application

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page initially and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the application. A SPA works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use. The apps you use on a daily basis including Gmail, Facebook, Google Docs, and Google Maps are SPAs.
