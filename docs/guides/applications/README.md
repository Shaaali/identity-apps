# Integrate apps with Asgardeo

Regardless of the application type or the development technology, you can connect your application with Asgardeo and control the way users log in to your app.

## Register applications

Currently, Asgardeo supports integrating two application types. When you select an application type, Asgardeo provides all the recommended configs in place by default which you can change as needed later.

### Single-page applications

Single-page applications(SPAs) are apps that run on the browser and do not require a page reload with a change 
in content. 

The main advantage of a single-page application is its speed. Since content is dynamically updated as the user interacts with it, the user does not need to wait for page reloads. Users can experience a seamless flow with high responsiveness from the application. 

JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as AngularJS, React, Vue.js, are some popular technologies adopted to build SPAs.

### Web applications

Web applications(web apps) are the most common type of applications in use. They are usually hosted on a web server
and accessed by the browser. Web applications need authentication as they offer functionality dependent on the logged-in user.

- <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/web-app/register-oidc-web-app/')">Register a web application with OIDC</a>
- <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/web-app/register-saml-web-app/')">Register a web application  with SAML</a>

## Design the login flow

When you register an application, you can customize the login flow.

- Configure Asgardeo login for <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/spa/add-login-to-single-page-app/')">single-page applications with OIDC</a> or <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/web-app/add-login-to-web-app/')">web applications</a> with OIDC or SAML.

- Add <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/social-login/')">social login</a> options such as <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/social-login/add-google-login/')">Google</a>, <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/social-login/add-facebook-login/')">Facebook</a>, and <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/social-login/add-github-login/')">Github</a>.

- Add other <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/enterprise-login/')">enterprise identity providers</a> as login options.

- Configure the number of factors (2FA or MFA) in the login flow to enforce <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/mfa/')">multi-factor authentication</a>.

- Enforce <a :href="$withBase('/guides/conditional-auth/')">conditional authentication</a> to dynamically change the login flow of a user based on the userâ€™s devices, networks, locations, or usage contexts.

## Manage user attributes

Manage the user attributes you want to share with your application:

- <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/user-attributes/enable-attributes-for-oidc-app/')">Enable user attributes for OpenID Connect apps</a>
- <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/user-attributes/enable-attributes-for-saml-app/')">Enable user attributes for SAML apps</a>

## Manage connections

An Identity Provider (IdP) is responsible for authenticating users and issuing identification information by using security tokens like SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Trust.

Authenticating the users by trusting an assertion from an external identity provider is popularly known as **identity federation**. Identity federation helps to reduce the sign-in and sign-up flows and provides the capability for the users to choose their trusted identity provider for sign-in.

Asgardeo supports a variety of external identity providers with various Open Standard protocols (eg:, OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML). You can configure any number of external identity providers to your application via Asgardeo.

Current trends require the usage of services from hundreds of websites in a connected world. Most of these websites need the user to create an account with them by providing a valid email address and password. Remembering all the different user IDs and passwords that you use can be difficult and cumbersome. To make life easier most websites now provide the user with an option to log in using their Facebook account, Twitter account, Google account, etc. Since most internet users have one of these accounts, it makes creating a new account an instant action.

To make this process much easier, the Asgardeo comes with a set of more specific identity providers:

- <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/social-login/')">Social identity providers</a>
- <a :href="$withBase('/guides/connections/enterprise-login/')">Enterprise identity providers</a>

To connect to other identity providers, which are not social identity providers, you can use open-standard enterprise login.
