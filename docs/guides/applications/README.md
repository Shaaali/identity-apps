# Manage applications

Regardless of the application type or the development technology, you can use Asgardeo to simply add authentication 
to your application by picking one of the supported standard protocols.

Currently, Asgardeo supports integrating two application types.
* [Single page applications](./spa/README.md)
* [Web applications](./web-app/README.md)

When you register an application in Asgardeo you can, 

* **Enable login with a standard authentication protocol**: To add authentication for your applications, Asgardeo 
provides standard open specifications and identity protocols like OpenID Connect and SAML.
  
* **Decide user attributes to be shared with your application**: With Asgardeo you can manage the user attributes you 
want to share with an application. This means, without sharing all the user attributes, you can decide to share only 
the user attributes required for the application.
  
* **Design the login flow**: You can decide which factor to be used as the second layer of authentication or the 
number of factors to be used as additional authentication layers or factors like social login.
  
* **Enforce conditional authentication**: You are given the choice to dynamically modify the login flow of a user 
based on the userâ€™s devices, networks, locations, or usage contexts.
