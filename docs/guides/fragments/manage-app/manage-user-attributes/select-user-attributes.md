You need to first specify the user attributes required for an application. This ensures that, when a user logs in, the application can only get access to the user information exposed through these attributes.

To add user attributes to the app:
1. Go to the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io) and click **Develop > Applications**.
2. Select your application and go to **User Attributes** section.
