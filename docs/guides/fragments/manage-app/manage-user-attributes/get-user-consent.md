Once the user is logged in to Asgardeo, Asgardeo requests consent from the end user to share user attributes with the application. 

If the user **does not have** the attribute details in the <a href="/guides/user-management/manage-users/user-profiles/">user profile</a>, Asgardeo will prompt the user to enter the **mandatory** user attributes during log in.  

The customer user can do one of the following:
1. **Select All** and click **Allow**. 
    - This will allow all attributes to be shared with application.
2. Selectively select user attribute and click **Allow**. 
    - This will share only the selected user attributes with the application. But user can't unselect the mandatory user attributes.
3. If user does not want to share any of the requested user attributes, user can click **Deny**. 

Asgardeo will not prompt for consent for the allowed attributes again unless a user revokes the provided consent via MyAccount.
