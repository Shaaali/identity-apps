Once the user is logged in to Asgardeo, Asgardeo requests consent from the end user to share user attributes with the application.

If the user **does not have** the attribute details in the <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/manage-customers/#manage-the-customer-s-profile')">user profile</a>, Asgardeo will prompt the user to enter the **mandatory** user attributes during login.  

The user can do one of the following during login:

- Select specific user attributes and click **Allow**.

    This will share only the selected user attributes with the application. However, note that the user cannot unselect the mandatory user attributes.

- If the user does not want to share any of the requested user attributes, they can click **Deny**.

Asgardeo will not prompt for consent for the allowed attributes again unless a user revokes the provided consent via MyAccount.
