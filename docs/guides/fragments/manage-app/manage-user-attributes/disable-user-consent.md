Asgardeo prompts users with a consent page. From the consent page, users can select the attributes that can be shared with the application or deny the consent request.

If you  don't want to provide that control to users, you can disable the consent screen.

To disable the consent page:
1. Log in to the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io) and select application to disable user consent.
2. Navigate to the **Advanced** section.
3. Enable **Skip login consent**.
