Asgardeo prompts for consent page to get consent from users to allow sharing user attributes. From the consent page, customer users can select the attributes that can be shared with application or deny the request.

If you  don't want to provide that control to users, you can disable consent screen.

To disable consent page:
1. Login to [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io) and select application to disable user consent.
2. Navigate to **Advanced** section.
3. Enable **Skip login consent**.
