These configurations are enabled only if refresh token grant type is added as an allowed grant type.

#### Renew refresh token
Asgardeo issues a new refresh token each time when access token is refreshed with refresh token grant type. The previous token gets invalidated.

If the application does not want to get a new refresh token for each request, you can clear the **Renew refresh token** checkbox. Then, the same refresh token will be issued with refresh token grant type until the refresh token expires.

#### Refresh token expiry time
