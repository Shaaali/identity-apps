# Add MFA with TOTP

The Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a temporary passcode, generated by an algorithm, which can be used only once. The algorithm that generates each password uses the current time of the day, which ensures that each password is unique.
TOTP is considered more secure because the passcode is valid only for a short window of time. The TOTP generated by Asgardeo is valid for **30** seconds.

To use TOTP as a multi-factor authentication(MFA) option, application users need to have an authenticator app that can scan the QR code and generate a one-time password. Some authenticator apps are:
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
- [Authy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy)

::: info
TOTP authenticators use the [TOTP specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) to calculate access tokens based on the current time and the secret key shared between the user and the identity provider.

## Prerequisites
-   To get started, you need to have an application registered in Asgardeo. If you don't already have one, register one of the following application types.
    -   <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/register-single-page-app/')">Single-page app</a>
    -   <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/register-oidc-web-app/')">Web app with OIDC</a>
    -   <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/register-saml-web-app/')">Web app with SAML</a>
-   Download and install one of the authenticator apps mentioned above.

::: info Info
 - You can use TOTP for multi-factor authentication only if a previous authentication step is configured with **username and password** or another factor that can validate user credentials.
 - TOTP cannot be used as the first step of your login flow.
 - Federated users (users who are authenticated using external IdPs) can log in with TOTP MFA option.

## Enable TOTP for an app

Follow the steps given below to enable **TOTP** as the second factor in the login flow of your application. 

1. On the Asgardeo console, use one of the following options to start:
    - Option 1: Go to **Develop > Applications**.
    - Option 2: Go to **Connections > TOTP** and click **Set up**.
2. Select the application for which TOTP needs to be added.
3. Go to the **Sign-in Method** tab and add the TOTP authenticator:

    - If you don't have a customized login flow, you can click **Add TOTP as a second factor**.

      This opens the customized login flow with TOTP as a second-factor authenticator:
    
    - If you have an already customized login flow, you can add a second step and add TOTP as the authenticator.

5. Click **Update** to save your changes.

## Enroll TOTP during first login 

Application users can enroll for TOTP notifications when they log in to the business application the first time. Given below are the steps that a user will follow:

1. Download an authenticator app to a mobile device.
2. Try to log in to the application by providing credentials. The user is prompted with a QR code.
3. Scan the QR code using the authenticator app, select the checkbox, and click **Continue**. 
    ::: info
    Note that this step is prompted only when the user attempts to log in for the first time.

6. Click **Continue** to continue login.

::: info
If the QR code is deleted from the authenticator app, there is no way to recover it from the application's end. In a scenario like this, the user should enroll TOTP through the <b>Multi Factor Authentication</b> option in the My Account portal.
