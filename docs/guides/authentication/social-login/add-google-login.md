# Add Google Login

You can add Google login to your applications using Asgardeo and enable users to log in with their Google account.  

Follow this guide for instructions.

## Register Asgardeo on Google
You need to register Asgardeo as an OAuth2.0 application on Google.

::: info
You can follow the [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849) for detailed instructions.
:::

1. Go to the [Google Developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.

    ::: info
    If the **APIs & services** page isn't already open, expand the left panel and select **APIs & services**.
    :::

4. Click **Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
    ::: info
    At this point, you can choose to configure your consent screen by clicking **Consent Screen**. For more information, see [User Consent](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849#userconsent&zippy=%2Cuser-consent).
    :::
6. Select the application type as **Web application**.
7. Provide the following URL as the **Authorized Redirect URI** of the application:
    ```bash no-line-numbers
    https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<organization_name>/commonauth
    ```
8. Get the client ID and client secret generated for the application.
    
## Register the Google IdP

Now, let's register the Google IdP in Asgardeo.

1. On the Asgardeo console, go to **Develop > Connections**.
2. Click **New Connections** and select **Google**.
3. Enter the following details of the Google identity provider and click **Finish**:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A unique name for this Google identity provider.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client ID</td>
          <td>The client ID obtained from Google.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client secret</td>
          <td>The client secret obtained from Google.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>    

After the Google identity provider is created, go to the **Settings** tab and see the list of **scopes** to which Google has granted permissions.

- **email**: Allows to view the user's email address.
- **openid**: Allows authentication using OpenID Connect and to obtain the ID token.
- **profile**: Allows to view the user's basic profile data. 

::: info
Asgardeo needs these scopes to get user information. Asgardeo checks the attribute configurations of the application and sends the relevant attributes received from Google to the app. You can read the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#scope-param) to learn more.

##  Enable Google login
::: info Before you begin
You need to have an application registered in Asgardeo. If you don't already have one, register one of the following application types:

-   <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/register-single-page-app/')">Single-page app</a>
-   <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/register-oidc-web-app/')">Web app with OIDC</a>
-   <a :href="$withBase('/guides/applications/register-saml-web-app/')">web app with SAML</a>
:::

1. On the Asgardeo console, go to **Develop > Applications**.
2. Open your application from the list and go to the **Sign-in Method** tab.
