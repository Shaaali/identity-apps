# Get started

First things first! To start off, let's create an organization and add a user to it. This organization will be your 
own unique space and will contain your users, groups, and applications. Once you create your organization you can 
access it via the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io/login), where  you can also create more associated 
organizations.

Let's get you started with Asgardeo!

## Create an organization

1. [Sign up](https://asgardeo.io/early-signup) for an Asgardeo account.

2. You will receive an invitation mail to your email address. Click **Try Asgardeo Beta** and create your new account.

3. Enter a unique organization name that describes the workspace.

## Create a user

Asgardeo supports a set of user account types to suit your organizational needs. Let's start off by creating a 
customer account.
