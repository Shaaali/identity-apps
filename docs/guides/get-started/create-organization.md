# Get started

First things first! To start off, let's create an organization and add a user to it. This organization will be your 
own unique space and will contain your users, groups, and applications.

Let's get you started with Asgardeo!

## Create an organization

1. [Sign up](https://asgardeo.io/early-signup) for an Asgardeo account.

2. You will receive an invitation mail to your email address. Click **Try Asgardeo Beta** and create your new account.

   ::: tip Tip

   Your new password should contain at least eight characters and must include an uppercase and lowercase letter, a
   number, and a symbol.
   :::

3. Enter a unique organization name that describes the workspace.

   > For more information, see [multitenancy](../../concepts/user-mgt/multitenancy.md).

- [Onboard more consumer users](../users/consumer-users.md)
- [Invite a guest user](../users/guest-users.md)
- [Create roles](../users/create-role.md)
