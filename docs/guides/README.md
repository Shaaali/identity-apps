# Asgardeo Overview

Asgardeo is an identity as a service (IDaaS) solution that provides a fully integrated developer experience to create
 seamless login experiences in minutes. You can get started with common IAM use cases with no installation or 
 maintenance hassles. 

We provide,
* **Simplified IAM integrations:** With out-of-the-box "integrations as a service" model, you can easily integrate 
any 3rd party apps and services without building from scratch. Asgardeo can integrate with any application, be it 
web, mobile, legacy, homegrown, and various systems that enable CRM, data management, and consent management.
  
* **Rich developer ecosystem:** You can simply cater to your unique and complex identity requirements with the use of
 our prebuilt SDKs, IDE integration capabilities, and templated scripts. We are secure, simple, and stackable to 
 enable your team to deliver a seamless user experience.
 
* **Scalable authentication:** With Asgardeo, you can experience the simplicity in adding authentication to any 
application, easy onboarding, and managing users for secure access. With the user store as a service, users can be 
easily onboarded and managed reducing complexities or set up time.

## Core use cases

Let's take a look at the core use cases of Asgardeo.

* **Single sign on**  
With Asgardeo you can enable users to provide their credentials once and obtain access to multiple applications. Thus
 they do not have the issue of remembering multiple username/password pairs to access multiple services. User 
 identities are managed at a central point. This is more secure, less complex, and easily manageable.
                                
* **Identity federation**  
Use Asgardeo to allow your users federated access to multiple systems across multiple trust domains using open 
identity standards. With Bring Your Own Identity (BYOID) approach, we provide social login with well-known identity 
providers.
                              
* **Adaptive and multi-factor authentication**  
Use Asgardeo to ensure secure access for your users by enabling adaptive and multi-factor authentication (MFA). You 
can apply the right level of security to each and every login request based on the userâ€™s devices, networks, 
locations, and usage contexts instead of having a pre-configured static login flow for everyone to follow, under all 
circumstances.
  
* **User management**  
You can manage user identities securely and efficiently within Asgardeo. This includes CRUD operations on users, 
controlling user activity through permissions, managing groups, defining authentication policies, managing external 
user stores, manual/automatic log-out, and resetting user passwords.
        
* **Self-service capabilities**  
Asgardeo provides self-service interfaces for users to self-register, reset passwords, and manage their user accounts
 with ease.
  
* **Easy consent management**  
With Asgardeo your users can selectively opt-in/opt-out on which user attributes they want to share with applications, 
easily review the consents they have provided for each application, and can revoke one or many of them as required.
