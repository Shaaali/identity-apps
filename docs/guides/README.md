easily onboarded and managed reducing complexities or set up time.

## Core use cases

Let's take a look at the core use cases of Asgardeo.

* **Single sign on**  
With Asgardeo you can enable users to provide their credentials once and obtain access to multiple applications. Thus
 they do not have the issue of remembering multiple username/password pairs to access multiple services. User 
 identities are managed at a central point. This is more secure, less complex and easily manageable.
                                
* **Identity federation**  
Use Asgardeo to allow your users federated access to multiple systems across multiple trust domains using open 
identity standards. With Bring Your Own Identity (BYOID) approach, we provide social login with well known identity 
providers.
                              
* **Adaptive and multi-factor authentication**  
Use Asgardeo to ensure secure access for your users by enabling adaptive and multi-factor authentication (MFA). You 
can apply the right level of gateway security to each and every login request based on the user’s devices, networks, 
locations and usage contexts instead of issuing static procedures for everyone to follow, under all circumstances.
  
* **User management**  
You can manage user identities securely and efficiently within Asgardeo. This includes adding/deleting users, 
controlling user activity through permissions, managing groups, defining authentication policies, managing external 
user stores, manual/automatic log-out, and resetting user passwords.
        
* **Self-service capabilities**  
Asgardeo provides self-service interfaces for users to self register, reset passwords, and manage their user 
information.
  
* **Easy consent management**  
With Asgardeo your users can selectively opt-in/opt-out on each data processing purpose, easily review the consents 
they have provided for each application and also can revoke one or many of them as required.
