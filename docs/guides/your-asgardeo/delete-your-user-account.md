# Delete your user account

If you have a requirement to delete your own user account from Asgardeo, see the guidelines and instructions given below.

## Owners

If you are the owner of one or multiple Asgardeo organizations, you will have user accounts (of type **Owner**) in each organization. Currently, you are not allowed to remove your owner accounts or to transfer your ownership of organizations to other users.

To delete your owner account(s), you need to <a :href="$withBase('/guides/your-asgardeo/delete-organizations/')">remove the organizations that you own</a>. 

## Collaborators 

If you want to remove your collaborator user account from an organization, you need to send a request to another administrator in the organization. See the instruction on <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/manage-collaborators/#delete-a-collaborator')">deleting collaborators</a>.

::: info
Note that removing your collaborator account from one organization only removes your association with that organization. Your collaborator account will continue to persist in other organizations that you are associated with.
