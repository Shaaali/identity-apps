# Manage your organizations

Admins can create multiple organizations via the Asgardeo console and switch between the created organizations. Users or the applications created in one organization cannot access the other organization's resources unless they are onboarded to that organization.

The admin who creates the organization is the owner of the organization.

## Create an organization
You can create a new organization via the Asgardeo console.

1. On the Asgardeo console, click your organization name in the header.
2. Click **New Organization**.

3. Provide the **Organization Name**.
    ::: warning

    :::
    <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/guides/organization/manage-organizations/create-new-organization-form.png')" alt="Create new organization form" width="300">
4. Click **Create**.

## Switch between organizations

If you have multiple organizations, you can switch between them on the console.

1. On the Asgardeo console, click your organization name in the header.
2. Click **Switch Organization** to see the list of organizations you have.
