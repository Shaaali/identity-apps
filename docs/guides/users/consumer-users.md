# Onboard a consumer user

Adding new users to access your applications is called onboarding. To onboard a consumer user to Asgardeo, you can
either send them an invitation to join or you can add them to the tenant yourself. Consumer users can access and use
applications within your tenant.

> For more information about the types of users you can onboard, see [types of users](../../concepts/user-mgt/user-types.md).

## Invite a user to set their own password

1. On the Asgardeo Console, click **Manage > Users**.

2. Click **New User** and select **Consumer account**.

3. Fill in the user's details.

4. Select **Invite the user to set their own password**.

5. Click **Next**.

6. Click on the camera icon if you want to update the user picture.

7. Click **Finish**.

You can fill in more details about the user such as their mobile number or country, to complete their user profile. You
can also view their active sessions once they have set their password and logged in.
