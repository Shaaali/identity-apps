# Manage groups

A group is a collection of users who have the same privileges to access resources in an organization. 
    
One user can be assigned to any number of groups. Applications can get details about groups a user belongs to in the authentication response (e.g., ID token) from Asgardeo as a user attribute.                                                          

::: info
Only <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/manage-customers/')">users</a> can be assigned to a group.

For example, you can create the following user groups: `Admin`, `Manager`, and `Developer`. When one user group is granted access to a resource, it applies to all users in the group.
