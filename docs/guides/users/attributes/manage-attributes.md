# Manage attributes

An attribute is a piece of information about a particular user. It can be anything associated with the user, such as name, group, preferences, etc.

User attributes represent information directly related to the user, such as the street address, username, email, first name, and more.

You need user attributes to maintain the required user information in an organization. You can select the user information for your applications by using these attributes. Also, the user information displayed in user profiles is managed using attributes.
