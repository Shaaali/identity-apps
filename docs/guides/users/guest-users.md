# Invite a guest user 

Asgardeo can handle your user management and authenticate users for you. Follow the steps below to send an email invitation to a guest user to collaborate with your tenant. This user can be assigned to an administrative role and can manage your tenant but the user does not reside within your tenant. 

> For more information about the types of users you can onboard, see [types of users](../../concepts/user-mgt/user-types.md).

## Send invitation 

1. On the Asgardeo Console, click **Manage > Users**. 

2. Click **New User** and select **Guest account**. 
    > For more information, see [types of user accounts in Asgardeo](../../concepts/user-mgt/user-types.md). 

3. Enter the email address of the user. An invitation will be sent to the email address you enter here.
