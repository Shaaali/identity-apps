# Password recovery by customers

Customers in an Asgardeo organization can recover a forgotten password by following the instructions on the Asgardeo sign-in page provided that <a :href="$withBase('/guides/organization-settings/password-recovery/')">password recovery is enabled</a> for business users in the organization.

If you are signed in to your My Account portal, you can <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/self-service/customer/#change-password')">set a new password</a> from there.

To recover your password:
1. Go to the sign-in page via <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/self-service/customer/#access-my-account-portal')">My Account Portal</a> or a business application.
   <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/guides/organization/self-service/customer/recover-your-password.png')" alt="Recover your password">
2. Click **Forgot password?**
3. Enter your username and click **Send Reset Link**.
   <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/guides/organization/self-service/customer/forgot-your-password.png')" alt="Forgot your password">

   An email notification is sent to your email address. 

4. Open the email you received and click **Reset Password**.
   <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/guides/organization/self-service/customer/reset-password-email.png')" alt="Reset password email">
5. Enter new password and **Proceed**.

Now you have reset your password. You can sign in to your business applications and My Account portal using your new password.
