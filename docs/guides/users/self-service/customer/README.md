# Customer

An owner or a collaborator with administrative privileges can manage customer accounts. However, this is not always necessary since customers can easily manage their own Asgardeo accounts <a :href="$withBase('/guides/user-self-service/customer-self-service-portal/')">using the My Account portal</a>. This includes updating profile information, recovering passwords, managing consent to business applications they have access to. They can also self-register to an organization.
