An owner or a collaborator with administrative privileges can manage customer accounts. However, this is not always necessary since customers can easily manage their own Asgardeo accounts <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/self-service/customer/my-account')">using the My Account portal</a>. This includes updating profile information, recovering passwords, managing consent and business applications they have access to, etc. They can also <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/self-service/customer/self-register')">self-register</a> to an organization.
