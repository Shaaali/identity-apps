# Password recovery by owners and collaborators

If you are an owner or collaborator in an Asgardeo organization, you can recover a forgotten password by following the instructions on the Asgardeo sign-in page.

If you are already signed in to your My Account portal, you can <a :href="$withBase('/guides/users/self-service/asgardeo-user/#change-password')">set a new password</a> from there.

To recover your password:
1. Go to the Asgardeo sign-in page via the [My Account](https://myaccount.asgardeo.io/) portal or the [console](https://console.asgardeo.io/login).
2. Enter your username and click **Continue**.

4. Enter your username and click **Send Reset Link**. An email notification is sent to your email address. 
5. Open the email you received and click **Reset Password**.
   <img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/guides/organization/self-service/asgardeo-user/reset-password-email-asgardeo-user.png')" alt="Reset password email">
6. Enter the new password and **Proceed**.

Now you have reset your password. You can sign in to the console and the My Account portal using your new password.
