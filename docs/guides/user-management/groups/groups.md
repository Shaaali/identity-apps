# Groups

In simple terms, a group is called a collection of users who are granted the same privileges in an organization. A 
group can contain many users, and a user can belong to multiple groups. The admins of an organization can create 
groups, assign users to them and/or remove users from them. With Asgardeo, you can use this group attribute 
information to write business logic in your applications.

::: tip
Only customer users can be assigned to a group.

The **Source** is called the user store where the details of the groups are stored and managed. By default, these are 
managed in the **Local/Consumer** user store.
