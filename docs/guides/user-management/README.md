# Users Management

The users in Asgardeo are the digital representations of the identities of physical users who interact with your 
organization. With Asgardeo, the identity lifecycle of each of these users can be easily managed by the admins of the 
organization. 

The admins can grant users access to resources in your organization and control user access. Admins can also manage various user operations via the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io) and SCIM APIs.

Shown below are some main user management capabilities available in Asgardeo.
