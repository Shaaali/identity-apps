# Users

A user is the digital representation of a physical user who interacts with with a system. With Asgardeo, a unique 
user account is created for each user. Then they are assigned to roles or user groups that enable a certain set of 
permissions.
  
User management is vital for any application. This is because a user who is not authenticated and/or authorized 
properly will not be able to access an application and use it in a way that serves the user's requirements. Asgardeo 
provides a secure and efficient user management solution for you to manage your users easily. 

# Types of user accounts in Asgardeo

Asgardeo supports a set of user account types based on their relationship to the organization. Given below are the 
user account categories of Asgardeo.

* **Customer**: A user that is registered within the organization, and consumes and accesses applications in that 
organization. A customer can self-register or can be onboarded to an organization by its admins.
  
* **Collaborator**: A user who can manage the organization and has access to the organizationâ€™s administrative 
operations such as application onboarding and user management. A collaborator user can be invited to the organization
 and assigned with permissions by its admins.
  
* **Owner**: This is the owner of the organization who self-registers to Asgardeo by creating an organization. The 
owner has all the administrative rights to the organization.

# Source
The source determines where the user's credentials and details are stored and managed. A user account can reside in 
one of the following sources:

* **Asgardeo**: This is the global user store where organization owner and collaborator users are stored.
  
* **Local/Customer**: This is the default user store where details of the customer accounts of the organization are 
stored.
