# Learn by Use Case

Let's take a look at the core use cases of Asgardeo.

## Single sign on
With Asgardeo, you can enable users to provide their credentials once and obtain access to multiple applications. Thus,
 they do not have to remember multiple username/password pairs to access multiple services. User
 identities are managed at a central point. This is more secure, less complex, and easily manageable.

## Identity federation
Use Asgardeo to allow your users federated access to multiple systems across multiple trust domains using open
 identity standards. With Bring Your Own Identity (BYOID) approach, we provide social login with well-known identity
 providers.

## Conditional and multi-factor authentication
Use Asgardeo to ensure secure access for your users by enabling conditional and multi-factor authentication (MFA). You
 can apply the right level of security to each and every login request based on the userâ€™s devices, networks,
 locations, and usage contexts instead of having a pre-configured static login flow for everyone to follow under all
 circumstances.

- Try <a :href="$withBase('/guides/authentication/mfa/')">multi-factor authentication</a> with Asgardeo.
  
## User management
You can manage user identities securely and efficiently within Asgardeo. This includes applying CRUD operations on users,
 controlling user activities through permissions, managing groups, defining authentication policies, managing external
 user stores, managing manual/automatic logout, and resetting user passwords.

Asgardeo provides self-service interfaces for users to self-register, reset passwords, and manage their user accounts
 with ease.

## Consent management
With Asgardeo, your users can selectively opt-in/opt-out on which user attributes they want to share with applications,
 easily review the consents they have provided for each application, and revoke one or many of them as required.
