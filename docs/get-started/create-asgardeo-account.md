# Create your Asgardeo Account

First things first! To start off, you need to join an organization in Asgardeo. You can sign up and create your own organization or an administrator may send you an invitation email to get onboard.

An organization in Asgardeo will be your own unique space and it will contain your users configurations and application configurations. Once created, it can be accessed via the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io/).

Let's get you started with Asgardeo!
