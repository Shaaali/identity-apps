# Create your Asgardeo Account

First things first! To start off, you need to join an organization in Asgardeo. You can sign up and create your own organization or an administrator may send you an invitation email to join the organization.

An organization in Asgardeo will be your own unique space and it will contain your users and application configurations. Once created, it can be accessed via the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io/).

Let's get you started with Asgardeo!

## Sign up!

Let's sign up and create an account:

1. [Sign up](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/) for an Asgardeo account. 
    
    You will receive an invitation mail to your email address. 

2. Click **Try Asgardeo** and create your new account.
3. Enter a unique organization name that describes the workspace and sign up.

You can now manage your own user account and organization. <a :href="$withBase('/guides/your-asgardeo/')">Learn more</a>.

## Sign in to the console

Once you have signed up and created your Asgardeo account, you can [sign in to Asgardeo](https://console.asgardeo.io/). You can use your Asgardeo credentials or one of your existing social accounts.
