# Get started 

First things first! To start off, let's create a tenant and add a user to it. This tenant will be your own unique space and will contain your users, roles, and applications. 

Let's get you started with Asgardeo!

## Create a tenant

1. [Sign up](https://asgardeo.io/early-signup) for an Asgardeo account.

2. You will receive an invitation mail to your email address. Click **Try Asgardeo Beta** and create your new account.
    
    ::: tip Tip
    Your new password should contain at least eight characters and must include an uppercase and lowercase letter, a number, and a symbol.
    :::

2. Enter a unique tenant name that describes the workspace. 

    > For more information, see [multitenancy](../../concepts/user-mgt/multitenancy.md).
