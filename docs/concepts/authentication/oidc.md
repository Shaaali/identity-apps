# OpenID Connect

## What is OpenID Connect?

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol that builds on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It is not a replacement to OAuth2.0, but an extension that clients can request by including the 'openid' scope value in the Authorization Request. This protocol verifies user identity by authenticating the end user against the Authorization Server.
